<h2 id="ConsiderationsbeforemigrationfromORACLERACtoALTIBASEHDBReplication-Dataconsistency">Data consistency</h2>

<p>ALTIBASE Replication sender thread tries to transfer XLOG as soon as the changed transaction is issued.</p>

<p>However if there're numerous changed transactions, there may be unsent transaction log although sender thread works hard.</p>

<p>It can cause data inconsistency between ALTIBASE instances. In order to overcome this issue, ALTIBASE inroduce EAGER Replication.</p>

<p>ALTIBASE does not support 2-phase commit protocol, therefore, the order of transactions may not be kept.</p>

<h2 id="ConsiderationsbeforemigrationfromORACLERACtoALTIBASEHDBReplication-DDLExecutioninthereplicatedenvironment">DDL Execution in the replicated environment</h2>

<p>DDL statements cannot be executed on tables for which the replication recovery option has been<br />
specified.</p>

                <div class="message-content">
                            
<p>One of the extra replication features that ALTIBASE HDB supports is the recovery option.</p>

<p>If the OPTIONS value is set to 1 in the SYS_REPLICATIONS_ meta table, the recovery option is used,<br />
whereas if the OPTIONS value is set to 0, the recovery option is not used.</p>

<p>However, the recovery option cannot be changed while replication is active.</p>

<p>If the recovery option is not used, all of the recovery-related information maintained in the system is cleared.</p>
                    </div>
    </div>


<p>To execute DDL statements in such a case, drop the tables from the replication object and<br />
execute the DDL statements.</p>

<p>Futhermore, DDL statements cannot be executed while replication is running in EAGER mode.</p>

<p>To execute DDL statements in such a case, stop replication, execute the<br />
DDL statements, and start replication again.</p>

<p>Supposing that the name of a replication target table is t1, A user can execute DDL statements<br />
using REPLICATION_DDL_ENABLE option as follows.</p>

<h2 id="ConsiderationsbeforemigrationfromORACLERACtoALTIBASEHDBReplication-Foreignkeyconstraint">Foreign key constraint</h2>

<p>Because parent key makes a pair with child key in the foreign key, even in the event of change occurrence, it can be operated within a range of table having a parent key.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">It has few advantages in that it searches for a table which own parent key before change in a table having child key.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">We don't recommend you to choose this constraint in a replicated environment as in the filelds of communication which has a high priority in performance.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">It can cause problem of data consistency with a mixture of the local transaction and replicated transaction as well as performance degradation.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">A consistency problem will be likely to happen in a active:active</span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">(</span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><a href="http://aid.altibase.com/display/MGOK/About+Replication#AboutReplication-ActiveStandBy" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Refer to this page</a></span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">)</span> <span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">environment which can cause a conflict.</span></p>

<p>But, there is a way to use a foreign key in a replication environment by modifying a property.</p>

<p>We don't recommend you to use this property as well.</p>

<h2 id="ConsiderationsbeforemigrationfromORACLERACtoALTIBASEHDBReplication-Trigger">Trigger</h2>

<p>Change operation using trigger is not replicated, Because it doesn't pass change to a remote server on a replicated environment.</p>

<p>Even if rows of table, replication target table, is not modified by a triggering event, change will not be applied on the remotely replicated machine.</p>

<p>That's why a trigger doesn't pass the QP step internally, Trigger should be made on a remotely replicated machine.</p>

<p>The Query Processor (QP)<br />
When a user requests the execution of an SQL statement, the QP, which is responsible for processing SQL statements and is one of the main components of a DBMS, undertakes the following steps:<br />
parsing Checks the syntax of the SQL text and creates a parse tree<br />
validation Performs a semantics check on the SQL statement and extends the parse tree<br />
optimization Creates an optimized execution plan based on calculated data access costs<br />
binding host variable binding<br />
