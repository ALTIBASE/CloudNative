# CloudNative

CloudNative Repository is for development for Cloud Native DBMS based on Altibase 
We will approach many kind of approaches to develop Cloud Native DBMSs as belows:

1) Distributed database architecture with 1 Read/Write and Many Read nodes
2) Sharding architecture
3) Scalable In-Memory DBMS based Big memory virtualization technology powered by 3rd party    

Directory structure

1) BMT: Bench Mark Test Program
2) 1RW_NRead: 1 Read/Write & Many Read Architecture
3) DMES: Big memory virtualizaion technology 
4) Sharding: N Node Read/Write Architecuture
